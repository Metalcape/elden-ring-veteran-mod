# Veteran mod

As seen in Sabaku No Maiku and Cydonia's Shadow of the Erdtree "Veteran Run" streams.

## Installation

There is not much to see in this mod for now, as it was made specifically to be shown on stream, so there is no clear progression linking the different events, but if you want to try it, it's possible to play it using Mod Engine 2. The DLL must be compiled using CMake and loaded with mod engine by configuring its `.toml` file.
